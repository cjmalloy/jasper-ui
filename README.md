[![Artifact Hub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/jasper)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/jasper/jasper-ui)

Jasper-UI is the reference client for the
[Jasper Knowledge Management Server](https://github.com/cjmalloy/jasper)

## Quickstart
To start the server, client and database with a single admin user, run
the [quickstart](https://github.com/cjmalloy/jasper-ui/blob/master/quickstart/docker-compose.yaml)
docker compose file.

## Knowledge Management Client
As the reference client for the jasper protocol this project is designed to expose all
features of the jasper protocol with a user experience supporting devs and power users.

This client allows you to expressively annotate links with tags and your own ontology.
It can be left unmodded to act as a general purpose database or admin tool.
With modding single purpose UIs can be derived for prototyping, one-off use, or micro-frontends.
Modding can also augment existing general purpose functionality. See `src/app/mods` for bundled mods.
Other mod distributions may be compatible with this client or require a different client.
The same network can be used by multiple clients and unsupported features are silently ignored.

General Purpose Usage:
* RSS Reader
* AI Chat
* Bulletin Board
* Discussion Forum
* Wiki / Knowledge Base
* Business Workflow Automation
* Continuous Offsite Backups

## Features

### Text Editor
Markdown editor with support for rendering both markdown and HTML.
* Use `#tag` to create a tag link. Add a space for the usual markdown H1 "# Title".
* Any links in markdown will automatically be added to either sources or alternate URLs
* Use `[1]` or `[[1]]` to reference existing sources. The number will be the 1-based index of the source.
* Use `[alt1]` or `[[alt1]]` to reference alternate URLs. Use `[alt1](url)` to add an alternate URL. The
  number will be the 1-based index of the alternate URLs.
* Using `+user/charlie` with the inbox plugin installed will add `plugin/inbox/user/charlie`
  to the tags. Use `#+user/charlie` instead to simply link to the user without notifying them.
* Use `^` to create superscripts. Use in combination with source references for standard reference style such
  as `^[1]` or `^[[1]]`.
* Any links to a ref or tag will render a toggle button to expand inline (any link that starts
  with `/ref/` or `/tag/`, with or without the server host and base path).
* Links of the form `![=](www.example.com)` will add a ref entry inline.
* Links of the form `![](www.example.com)` will embed the contents of the Ref if it exists, or attempt to embed
  the url directly if it is an image, audio, video, or embeddable sites.
* Links of the form `![+](www.example.com)` will add a toggle button that will expand to show the contents
  of the Ref if it exists, or attempt to show the content directly if it is an image, audio, video, and embeddable
  sites.
* Links of the form `![](/tag/query)` will add results of a tag query inline.
### Tag Query Page
* Perform any tag query while performing a full text search and multi-column sort
* Displays title from tag Ext if present
* Displays sidebar markdown from tag Ext if present
* Displays pinned Refs from tag Ext if present
* Adds Modmail button that sends a DM to `plugin/inbox/tag`

## Developing
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The
application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
You can also use
`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Localizing

To update the localization file after new text is added run
`ng extract-i18n --output-path src/locale`.
Run
`xmlstarlet ed -N x="urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:1.2" -d "//x:context-group" src/locale/messages.xlf > src/locale/messages.<locale here>.xlf`
to generate a new translation file. Then add it to the `locales` array in `angular.json`.
