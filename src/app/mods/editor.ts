    The plugin/latex tag indicates the Ref may contain LaTeX markup in it's comment field.
    Be sure to delimit your latex with dollar signs $f(x)$, or double dollar signs $$f(x)$$ for block math.
    Remember to add the plugin/latex tag to your Refs or else it will be rendered as plaintext instead of MathML.
    The plugin/latex tag does not include any plugin data. Simply including it in the Ref tags array will activate LaTeX rendering.
    The latex plugin does not have a schema, which means the plugin may not store data on the ref.
    LaTeX is delimited with $ for inline math and $$ for block math.
    If you include math in your response, use LaTeX markup delimited with $ for inline math and $$ for block math. Do not escape LaTeX backslashes.
    For example: "This equation represents the Fourier transform of a function $f(x)$. The Fourier transform is a mathematical operation that transforms a function from the time or spatial domain to the frequency domain. In this equation, the integral of $f(x)$ multiplied by a complex exponential function, $e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}$, is taken over all values of $\\xi$, ranging from negative infinity to positive infinity."
    For example: "This equation represents an iterative evaluation of the continued fraction $\\cfrac{2}{1+\\cfrac{2}{1+\\cfrac{2}{1}}}$, which is commonly known as the golden ratio or $\\phi$."`,
