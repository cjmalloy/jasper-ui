    The plugin/thread tag indicates the Ref represents a comment in a threaded discussion.
    The first source (sources[0]) should be the immediate parent.
    The second source (sources[1]) should be the top of the thread.
    For top posts and first responses, including the top of the thread as both sources (sources[0] and sources[1])
    is recommended, as this will allow adding additional sources to be added without breaking threading.`,
